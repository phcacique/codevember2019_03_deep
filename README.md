## About this app
![preview image](/images/03_deep.PNG)

In order to represent deep, I was literal in the experiment. It represents a well and it's raining around it. The rain's pattern is a representation of a circular Conway's Game of Life.

_This is an iOS app, made in Swift, on XCode and it is a free visual experiment._
